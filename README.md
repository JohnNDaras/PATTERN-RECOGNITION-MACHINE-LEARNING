**<p align=center>Exploring Overfitting, Facial Recognition, and Regularization in Data Science Project**

In this project, three key questions were explored, focusing on logistic regression, overfitting, and the Eigenfaces method. Logistic regression was implemented in Python to plot the sigmoid function for varied ww values, elucidating the observed overfitting behavior for large ww. Consideration was given to regularization, along with its potential efficacy. Employing the Yale B face dataset for the Eigenfaces method, a function for loading images and labels was implemented, and training was conducted with differing dimensions (d=9d=9 and d=30d=30). Classification accuracy on distinct image subsets was reported, and visualizations included principal eigenvectors. Image reconstruction quality using Eigenfaces was assessed, and singular vectors obtained through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) were explored, along with their distinctions from corresponding eigenvectors.
